React starter project with base settings and packages included.

## Available Scripts

Runs the app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### `yarn lint`

Runs ESLint on the project.

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. This correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
